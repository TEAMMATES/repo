    Getting Started
  </h4>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Join the course</b> by clicking the link given in the email you received from TEAMMATES.<br>
      Note that you need to join a course only once per course.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Do the pending submissions</b> (if any).<br>
      You will need to <b>use the "Submit Feedback" button</b> in order to submit your responses
      (including any intermediate/draft responses) as the system will not perform any kind of auto-save.
    </li>
    <li>You can <b>edit your submissions</b> up to the closing time of the respective session.</li>
    <li>You can <b>view session results</b> after the instructor has published session results. The system will notify
      you via email when results are available for viewing.
    </li>

    Troubleshooting
  </h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>What should I do if I cannot see any/some of my courses I should be able to see in the system?</b>
      <div>
        These are the possible reasons:
        <ol>
          <li>
            You used a different Google account to access TEAMMATES in the past.
            In that case, you need to use the same Google account to access TEAMMATES again.
            Logout and re-login using the other Google account.
          </li>
          <li>
            You changed the primary email from a non-Gmail address to a Gmail address recently.
            In that case, email <a href="mailto:{{ supportEmail }}">{{ supportEmail }}</a> so that we can
            reconfigure your account to use the new Gmail address.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>What should I do if I'm unable to submit my response?</b>
      <div>
        <a href="mailto:{{ supportEmail }}">Email us</a> so that we can assist you with your submission.
        Note that we cannot do much if the submission deadline is over. It is not up to us (the TEAMMATES team) to
        accept overdue submissions.

    Frequently Asked Questions
  </h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Am I required to join the course to submit my feedback?</b>
      <div>
        No. Joining a course is optional, but there are benefits in doing so. <br>
        If you do not join, you can still submit feedback and view feedback responses using links sent to you by
        TEAMMATES. <br>
        If you do join, you get access to extra features such as the ability to see all your feedback sessions in
        a single home page.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>

          <li>
            Note: If your instructor provided a recommended length, it will show up below the text box.

      <b>Multiple Choice Questions</b>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Follow the directions and make your corresponding selection. If there are specific restraints such as the
            minimum or maximum number of selections, it will be noted below the prompt.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the question allows for only one selection, choose the radio button (circle) next to each option.
            If the question allows for more than one selection, the choices will have a box next to each option
            that you can select.
          </li>
          <li>
            If your instructor allowed for an "Other" option, select it and enter your comment inside the text box.
          </li>
          <li>
            Note: The choices may be weighted.
          </li>
        </ol>

    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Numerical Scale Questions</b>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Enter a scale number in the text box provided.
          </li>
          <li>
            The sample scale shown inside the brackets will give you an idea of what number to input
          </li>
          <li>
            For an example scale of [1, 1.5, 2, ..., 4, 4.5, 5]: <br>
            We see the minimum value is 1, the maximum value is 5, and the increment is 0.5. <br>
            For the given scale, examples of valid answers are: 1, 2.5, 3.5, 5, etc.
          </li>

      <b>Distribute Points Questions</b>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A note will show with the total number of points that you can distribute towards different choices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Divide up the points, as you see fit, and write the number in the corresponding text boxes.
          </li>
          <li>
            If there is a discrepancy with the total number of points and the sum of the points divided amongst choices,
            the comment at the bottom of the question will help you identify any missing or extra points allotted.
          </li>

      <b>Team Contribution Questions and Equal Shares Scale</b>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Select the corresponding choice from the drop-down box for each evaluee/recipient.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Equal Share scale is a relative measure of individual contribution to a team task. <br>
            For example, in a 3-person team, Equal share means a third of the work done. <br>
            Equal share + 10% means the person did about 10% more than an equal share, <br>
            Equal share - 10% means about 10% less than an equal share, and so on.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Rubric Questions</b>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Select the corresponding statement and your choice from the rubric. The statement will be on the left
            (rows), and your choice will be on the top (column). Your selection should match with the statement and
            choice you are choosing.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Rank Questions</b>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Select the corresponding rank from the dropdown menu that matches with each choice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Note: Your instructor may allow you to give the same rank to multiple options. If this is not allowed,
            you will see an error below the question.
