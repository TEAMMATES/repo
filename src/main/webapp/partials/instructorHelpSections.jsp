            <p>
                Sections are meant to organize students where the course has significantly large number of students. It is mandatory for courses with more than 100 students to organize a student into a section.
                You are allowed to have sections for courses with less than 100 students, but it is not mandatory.

                You can specify the section of each student at the time of enrollment. You just have to include a
                <b>'Section'</b> column in the spreadsheet or the student data you mention in the text box.
                <br>More information can be found on the course enrollment page.
                Go to the
                <b>'Courses'</b> page. You will see the list of courses, then click on
                <b>'Enroll'</b> button in the last column of the row corresponding to the course to which you want to enroll students. Scroll down to the <b>'More Info'</b> section.
