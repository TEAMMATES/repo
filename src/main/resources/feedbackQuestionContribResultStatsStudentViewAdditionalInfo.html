<ul class="bulletedList">
  <li>
    Compare the values given in 'My view' with those under 'Team's view'.
    This tells you whether your perception matches with what the team thinks,
    particularly regarding your own contribution. You may ignore minor differences.

    The team's view of your contribution is the average value of the contribution your
    team members attributed to you, excluding the contribution you attributed to yourself.
    That means you cannot boost your perceived contribution by claiming a high contribution
    for yourself or attributing a low contribution to team members.
