# Maintainer Guide

This document details the tasks that need to be done by core team (afterwards "team") members (project maintainers) in order to keep the project moving.

It is assumed that the team members are familiar with the [development workflow](process.md), [individual development process](development.md), and the terms used in the project as listed in those documents, [project glossary](glossary.md), [issue labels](issues.md), and beyond.
