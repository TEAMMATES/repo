<h4 id="interpret">How do I interpret these results? </h4>
<ul class="bulletedList">
  <li>
    Compare the values given in 'My view' with those under 'Team's view'.
    This tells you whether your perception matches what the team thinks,
    particularly regarding your own contribution. You may ignore minor differences.
  </li>
  <li>
    The team's view of your contribution is the average value of the contribution your
    team members attributed to you, excluding the contribution you attributed to yourself.
    That means you cannot boost your perceived contribution by claiming a high contribution
    for yourself or attributing a low contribution to team members.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="grading">How are contribution question results used in grading?</h4>
<ul class="bulletedList">
  <li>
    TEAMMATES does not calculate grades. It is up to the instructors to use contribution question results in any way they want.
    However, TEAMMATES recommends that contribution question results are used only as flags to identify teams with contribution imbalances.
    Once identified, the instructor is recommended to investigate further before taking action.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="calculation">How are the scores for contribution questions calculated?</h4>
Here are the important things to note:
<ul class="bulletedList">
  <li>
    The contribution you attribute to yourself is not used when calculating the perceived
    contribution of you or team members.
  </li>
  <li>
    From the estimates you submit, we try to deduce the answer to this question:
    In your opinion, if your teammates are doing the project by themselves without you,
    how do they compare against each other in terms of contribution? This is because we
    want to deduce your unbiased opinion about your team members’ contributions. Then,
    we use those values to calculate the average perceived contribution of each team member.
  </li>
  <li>
    When deducing the above, we adjust the estimates you submitted to remove artificial
    inflation/deflation. For example, giving everyone <code>[Equal share + 20%]</code> is as same as giving
    everyone <code>[Equal share]</code> because in both cases all members have done a similar share of work.
  </li>
  <li>
    The sum of values in the team's view has been scaled so that it
    equals the sum of values in your view. That way, you can make a direct comparison
    between your view and the team’s view. However, the values you see in team’s view may also
    not match the values your team members see in their results.
  </li>
</ul>
