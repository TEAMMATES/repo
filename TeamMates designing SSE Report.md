### Observations From The OSS Project 

####As per the design document of TeamMates, the Logic component which includes LoginServlet sanitizes input values received from web browser to UI server, login information generated by a Gatekeeper logic. The third-party spoofing can be reduced by providing authorization to various users. 

#####Â·TeamMates follows secure authorization practices such as role-based login to prevent unauthorized access to a module which avoids using effusive messages while throwing an exception which prevents disclosure of sensitive data.
