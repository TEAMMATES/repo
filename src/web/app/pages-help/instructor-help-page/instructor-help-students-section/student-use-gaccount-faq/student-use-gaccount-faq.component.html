                    Students can submit feedback and view results without having to login to TEAMMATES, unless they choose to link their Google account (optional). TEAMMATES will send students a unique URL to access their feedback sessions and results. However, students
                    who link their TEAMMATES account with their Google account will be able to access a dashboard of all their sessions and results through the TEAMMATES website.
