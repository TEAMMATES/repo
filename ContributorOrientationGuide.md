<span>We</span> <span>welcome contributions from anyone, in particular, students (see</span> <span class="c0">[here](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://teammatesv4.appspot.com/about.html&sa=D&ust=1455532227208000&usg=AFQjCNE2HQWbmYPQLZnoH2wMZc-e8uCLyQ)</span><span> for a list of our contributors). One of the main objectives of TEAMMATES is to help students get experience in a OSS production environment. Here are some information that might be useful to would-be contributors.</span>

## <a id="h.abftcg92xk1k"></a><span>Knowledge required</span>

<span>Although TEAMMATES uses many tools and technologies, you need not know all of them before you can contribute. The diagram below shows which technologies you need to learn to contribute in different roles. As you can see, some roles don't need learning any technologies at all. Note that these role aren't fixed or formally assigned. It is simply for guidance only.</span>

## <a id="h.4es3v3yquxal"></a><span>Getting started</span>

<span>Contributing to an OSS project requires you to figure out things on your own when you can and seek help from the right resource when you cannot. To become a TEAMMATES contributor, you need to start honing those skills. To help you with that, we have created a sequence of tasks you can try to complete.  Try to complete as many of them as you can, in the order they are listed. Of course we are happy to guide you if you encounter any difficulties when doing these tasks; just post your question in</span> <span class="c0">[our issue tracker](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/issues&sa=D&ust=1455532227215000&usg=AFQjCNF7Mhua1nOcLtm3qr46Z-NfMz-1oQ)</span><span>. If you are seeking help on project setup, remember to include the below in your post.</span>

<span class="c4">1\. Step in the setting up guide that you are in</span>

<span class="c4">2\. What measures you took to address the issue</span>

<span class="c4">3\. Operating system</span>

<span class="c4">4\. Screenshots (of any)</span>

<span></span>

<span>Note: The task descriptions are brief by intention. We want you to try to figure out how to do those things by yourself.</span>

<span class="c5 c22">Orientation task list</span>

<span class="c5"></span>

<span class="c5 c3">Phase A:</span><span class="c3"> know the project</span>

1.  <span>U</span><span>nderstand what TEAMMATES is about.</span>

*   <span class="c0">[product intro page](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://teammatesv4.appspot.com&sa=D&ust=1455532227218000&usg=AFQjCNG86i7fb9zMhFZmA0ZT_GfKXkrLNg)</span><span> shown to potential users</span>
*   <span class="c0">[project vision, challenges, and principles](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://teammatesv4.appspot.com/dev/devman.html%23project&sa=D&ust=1455532227219000&usg=AFQjCNGITS94fuH6N4pV26LHhBA3-vFXsQ)</span>
*   <span class="c0">[feature overview](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://teammatesv4.appspot.com/features.html&sa=D&ust=1455532227219000&usg=AFQjCNFlenuSxIN07Xut1LRYw6844woR4w)</span><span> (users’ point of view)</span>

1.  <span>Decide in which role(s) you want to contribute. i.e.,</span> <span class="c9">tester</span><span>,</span> <span class="c9">copy-editor</span><span>, etc. as specified</span> <span class="c0">[earlier in this document](#id.49lgk6iu1w59)</span><span>.</span>
2.  <span>If you are aiming for</span> <span class="c9">tech writer</span><span> or</span> <span class="c9">tester</span><span> roles, get an instructor account using the link in the TEAMMATES home page. Remember to mention the purpose of your request under</span> <span class="c9">any other comments</span><span>.  
    If you are sure you want to become a contributor, you can skip this step. In Phase B, you get to set up TEAMMATES on your own machine and use that instance to try the functionality.</span>

<span></span>

<span>If you plan to contribute code, continue with the tasks below.</span>

<span></span>

<span class="c5 c3">Phase B:</span><span class="c3"> set up locally</span>

1.  <span>Set up TEAMMATES development environment on your computer.  
    Important:  
    * Follow instructions to the letter.</span> <span class="c12">Install the specified versions of the tool stack, not the latest versions</span><span>.  
    * If you encounter any problems, refer to the</span> <span class="c0">[Developer Troubleshooting Guide](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_p7WOGryOStPfTGA_ZifE1kVlskb1zfd3HZwc4lE4QQ/pub?embedded%3Dtrue&sa=D&ust=1455532227223000&usg=AFQjCNF8TRM5abhu-9TWsZ1-VjNUAYDbuQ)</span><span>.</span>
2.  <span>Get</span> <span class="c9">dev green</span><span>. It is OK to proceed to the next phase if you have fewer than 5 failing test cases.</span>

<span></span>

<span></span>

<span class="c5 c3">Phase C:</span> <span class="c3">deploy</span>

1.  <span>Deploy your own copy of TEAMMATES to your</span> <span class="c9">staging server</span><span>.</span>

<span class="c5"></span>

<span class="c5 c3">Phase D:</span><span class="c3"> tinker with the code</span>

1.  <span>Fork our repo at GitHub</span>
2.  <span>Create a branch names ‘tinker’</span>
3.  <span>In that branch, d</span><span>o a small change to the code that makes a visible change to TEAMMATES UI. Preferably, your change should improve the UI in some way, or at least not make it worse.</span>
4.  <span>Deploy the changed version to your staging server.</span>
5.  <span>Push your changes to your fork.</span>
6.  <span>Create a new issue in our issue tracker with the following info  
    Issue title: ‘</span><span class="c4">New contributor self intro [your name]</span><span>’    
    </span><span class="c4">a) the link to your app  
    b) link to your fork  
    c) a screenshot of the change you did (as seen on the UI)  
    d) your real name and a short self-intro</span>

<span class="c5"></span>

<span class="c5 c3">Phase E:</span> <span class="c3">start contributing  
</span><span>After you complete the above tasks, you are ready to become a contributor.</span> <span>Steps for fixing an issue is explained in the</span> <span class="c0">[process](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/TEAMMATES/repo/blob/master/devdocs/process.md&sa=D&ust=1455532227228000&usg=AFQjCNGjGBpjnt8NlAF9m6VnusMyFrXU5A) </span><span>document. New contributors are advised to start doing an issue labeled</span> <span class="c1">d.FirstTimers</span><span> (but do not do more than one of those), move to other issues labeled as</span> <span class="c1">d.Contributors</span><span>  
</span>

<span class="c12">Important:</span>

<span>Fixing an issue quickly is not the important thing. In fact, issues given to new contributors are ones we already know how to fix. We are more interested to see how you go about fixing the issue. We want to know whether you are systematic and detail-oriented.  
Take your time to learn and follow the workflow to the letter. Do not skip any steps because you think that step is 'not important'. We are more impressed when you finish an issue in fewer attempts than when you finish it in a shorter time but take many attempts because you were not meticulous enough along the way.
