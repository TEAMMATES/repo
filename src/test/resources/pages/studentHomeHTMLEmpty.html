To access a course on TEAMMATES, first you need to wait till an instructor adds you to that course and TEAMMATES sends you instructions on how to access that particular course in TEAMMATES.
<br><br>
If you 'joined' the course in TEAMMATES using a Google account before,but cannot login anymore, these are the possible reasons:
<ol>
<li>
You used a different Google account to access TEAMMATES in the past. In that case, you need to use the same Google account to access TEAMMATES again. Logout and re-login using the other Google account. 
If you don't remember which Google account you used previously, email us from the same email account to which you receive TEAMMATES emails.
</li>
<li>
You changed the primary email from a non-Gmail address to a Gmail address recently. In that case, 
<a href="https://teammatesv4.appspot.com/contact.html">
email us 
</a>
so that we can reconfigure your account to use the new Gmail address.
</li>
<li>
You joined this course just a few seconds ago and your data may be still in the process of propagating through our servers. 
In that case, please click on the 
<a href=" + ActionURIs.STUDENT_HOME_PAGE + ">Home</a>
 link above in a few minutes.
