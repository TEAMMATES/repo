### Features
TEAMMATES gives you more flexibility over peer evaluations than other existing platforms:
* **Flexible feedback paths:** Create feedback paths within teams, between students, and between instructors and students
* **Customize visibility of responses:** Set visibility levels for each peer evaluation. Select who can see the response, and decide whether the feedback giver or receiverâ€™s identity is visible.
* **Grant access levels:** Add various instructors to your courses, and decide their access control (e.g. co-owner, manager, tutor or custom).

Take advantage of TEAMMATES powerful database:
* **Search feature:** Locate any student and their details.
* **Reuse past questions:** Save time and resurface past questions from existing sessions.
* **Download data as spreadsheets:** Download responses and statistics as spreadsheets.
* **Generate reports and statistics** in various formats and views. 

### Demos
